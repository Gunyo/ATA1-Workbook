#### Q1.
##### "Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe at least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time."

 1. 1983, the Domain System  Name (DNS) was established by Paul Mockapetris. He and his team at the University of South California simplified the ARPAnet's holding name system using IP to a dynamic naming system. As a result, domain names are easily identifiable by any users and this has lead to become the original Internet Standards we see today.

2. Stephen Wolff, known as one of many fathers of the Internet connected the suppercomputing centers owned by the governemt to regional networks in the U.S and international education networks. This was the first open computer to ever be established when Wolff took over the NSFNet program in 1986. Since then everyone has access to a computer either for personal or public use.  

3. As internet grew between North American and the Western Europe continents. A global connector by the name Professor Kilnam Chon, had an extensive role in promoting Internet policies, science, and advancement led to the Internet's growth in Asia. Being SDN the first internet to be developed in 1982, his work later motivated others by his groundbreaking work to support the Internet's continued development in the region and later become the hub of internet usage.

4. The "@" sign used in everyones email was created by Raymond Tomlinson. Since then he was put into head position of creating the required services in network electronic mail, setting a standard format for email messages, and designing a tool for creating and reading email. 

5. John Cioffi, the creator of Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) used to transmit data over a regular phone line. Compared to Dial-UP which was very unreliable as it disrupts the internet usage when a call is received. However DSL had different frequencies for phone and data which made made it through the development of reliable internet usage which "account for about 98% of the worldâ€™s more than 500 million DSL connections."

#### Q2.
##### "Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:"
 - ##### packets
 - ##### IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6)
 - ##### routers and routing
 - ##### domains and DNS

###### Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet.

##### 1. Packets:
A packet is a small amount of data sent over a network, such as a LAN or the Internet. Each packet includes a source and destination as well as the content (or data) being transferred. Leonard Kleinrock who theorised packets switching in July 1961 later became internets data transfers. Unlike circuits, packets was much more feasible of communications.  

##### 2. IP address (IPv4 and IPv6):
Internet Protocal (IP) address is a main set of rules that governs the exchange or transmition of data between devices on seperate networks. Different machines, routers, and websites all need to be distinguished on the internet. IP addresses are a crucial part of how the internet operates and offer a means of doing so.
- IPv4 which is a 32bit address only allows 4b unique address compared to IPv6 that is on a 128bit address that allows a substancial amount of unique address far greater than the previous version.

##### 3. routers and routing:
A router is a software programme that selects a path for data to be transmitted from a source to a destination known as a router, a special system that performs routeing. When a devices sends a data into the internet The packets are routed using routeing algorithms. The routeing algorithm is a piece of software that decides the most effective route for packet transmission. The router is a vital component of today's business networks, serving as a link to both the Internet and other networks.


##### 4. Domains and DNS:
DNS is the backbone of the Internet's operation. When you type a domain name into your browser, your machine consults a DNS server to determine the IP address associated with it. This is essential to which DNS ensures that the Internet are both user-friendly and efficiently loading the content that users request.

#### Q3.
##### Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:
 - TCP
 - HTTP and HTTPS
 - web browsers (requests, rendering and developer tools)

###### Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50 - 150 words for each technology)


##### 1. TCP:
